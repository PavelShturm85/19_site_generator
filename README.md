# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

*Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.*

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

# Quickstart
**Ways to use:**
- Have to use  module `site_generator.py` after `python3`.
  - This is create site in path `/pages`


Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:


```bash
$ python3 site_generator.py

```
